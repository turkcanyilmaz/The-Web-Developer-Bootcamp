<h2> Project 2: Score Keeper </h2>

- This is a basic website for keeping score in a ping pong game. It has a header, an image, and instructions on how to use it. You can select the score limit from a dropdown menu. There are buttons for each player and a reset button. When a player reaches the score limit, their score turns green, and the other player's score turns red, and the buttons become disabled. JavaScript is used to update the score and reset functions.
